Attendance: FULL ATTENDANCE EVERYONE ARRIVED ON TIME
Things we did this past week: created a Facebook group chat (so we'll only use Gitter to respond to users with questions), brainstormed about
what our specific first lesson/code game should be

Topics Discussed: the specific type of game we want to do for the Alpha release, we're thinking the first lesson we should teach users 
should be types and variables, later on we want to teach the users about functions, and then finish with helping the user create a twitter
bot; for the alpha release, we want to create a drag and drop game that teaches the users how to properly assign a variable, etc.
