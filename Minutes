Attendance: FULL ATTENDANCE EVERYONE ARRIVED ON TIME
Things we did this past week: created a Facebook group chat (so we'll only use Gitter to respond to users with questions), brainstormed about
what our specific first lesson/code game should be

Topics Discussed: the specific type of game we want to do for the Alpha release, we're thinking the first lesson we should teach users 
should be types and variables, later on we want to teach the users about functions, and then finish with helping the user create a twitter
bot; for the alpha release, we want to create a drag and drop game that teaches the users how to properly assign a variable, etc.

Tasks for Next Week:
Sai, Matt: touch up game design/close their issue
Ben, Cory, edit/complete first lesson/close their issue
Brian: finalize template for front-end

Attendance: Everyone here except Matt
Things we did this past week: made a first lesson that user can read to learn about types and strings
Topics Discussed: making first lesson more interactive (with something like multiple choice questions), eliminating google sign in 
for now and worrying about storing user progress for beta release, making home page simpler with basically just a "Get Started" button
for now

Tasks for Next Week:
Ben: add something interactive to first lesson
Cory: edit/add to first lesson, either start second lesson or add content to lesson #1
